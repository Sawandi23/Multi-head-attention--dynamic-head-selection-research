## Research Title
**Optimizing Dynamic Head Selection in Multi-Head Attention for Efficient and Interpretable Models**

---

## Abstract
Multi-Head Attention is a core component of Transformer architectures but suffers from redundancy, high computational cost, and limited interpretability. While prior research has explored static head pruning, most approaches fail to adapt dynamically to different inputs.

This study identifies a key research gap in **dynamic and interpretable head selection**, where attention heads are adaptively activated based on input context. Through an extensive literature review, the project highlights limitations of existing pruning methods and outlines future research directions toward building efficient, transparent, and context-aware Transformer models.
